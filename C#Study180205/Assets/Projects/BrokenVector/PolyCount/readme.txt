POLYCOUNT

Thank you for purchasing PolyCount!

This editor plugin allows you to count the polygons and vertices for the different models in your scene.

To open the editor window navigate to Tools -> PolyCount


The window should be pretty self explaining.
You can switch between polygon- and vertex- count mode.
Select 'Total' to show the stats of your current scene and 'Selection' to show the stats of your selected objects.
If you don't see all stats, make sure the window is big enough.

To disable the stats in the scene view, just uncheck "Show in scene view".
