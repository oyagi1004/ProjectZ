LOD - Combine, Decimate and Level of Detail
v1.0 - Released 17/09/2017 by Alan Baylis
----------------------------------------


Foreword
----------------------------------------
Thank you for downloading LOD. This program allows you to quickly and easily set up Unity style Level Of Detail for your models. Combine, Decimate and LOD all in one. It works with static meshes, skinned meshes and combinations of the two. Simply click a single button to decimate the objects and set up the desired LOD levels. Uses the familiar Unity LOD slider that allows you to quickly set up the transition distances.


Notes
----------------------------------------
LOD calculations are difficult to get right across all meshes. It will work very well on some meshes, like characters, but may look rough on other meshes, like cars with pinstripe detailing.
You can expect between 30% to 60% reduction in triangles in the lowest level of detail.
Suitable for high polygon meshes, as low polygon meshes often can't be optimized.
LOD levels do not preserve blend shapes.
