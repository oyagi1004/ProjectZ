Version 1.0 / 2017-06-03 
  * Initial release

Version 1.0.1 / 2017-07-04 
  * Correction in export when a meshCollider component uses a Mesh that is not present in the list of combined Meshes

Version 1.1.0 / 2017-10-21
  * Use the API BakeMesh from skinnedMeshRenderer to create a snapshot of the mesh in its current position. This solves the issue of always baking skinnedMeshes in their default T pose.
  * Correction of an issue causing error during combining process when a material uses a too big scale factor, resulting in a created texture exceeding the maximum texture size handled by Unity for the corresponding target plateform.
    If this case occures, an error is display in the log, and the resulting texture will be reduced to it's maximum possible size
  * Add a new parameter to enable combining at startup during runtime.

Version 1.1.1 / 2017-10-24
  * Add a tooltip explaining 'Max vertices count' parameter
  * Improve documentation (add tooltip for "Max vertices count" parameter and a paragraph to describe vertices >64k issue)

Version 1.2.0 / 2017-10-29
  * Add pragma #if UNITY_EDITOR in SaveTextures() function
  * Improve documentattion: add paragraph to explain possible quality loss
  * Optimization in copy texture process, leading to a big improvement in process speed (especially with tilled textures and UVs out of bound)
  * Fix unsupported compressed textures format
  * Merge color property of materials within the atlas texture for diffuse textures

 Version 1.3.0 / 2017-11-07
  * Add version number in asset title
  * Improvement in texture input process
  * Fix issue with material that don't have Color property
  * Improve process progression display: now progress bar correctly increments their value and offer a cancel button
  * Catch error during texture processing where texture format is not recognized or handled by Unity (for exemple: DDS). In this case replace the texture by a white texture and display a log error in console.
  * Improve documentation

  Version 1.3.1 / 2017-11-18
  * Limit texture size to 16384 regardless to the current plateform to prevent some cases of quality loss
  * Display destination folder in save settings and do not reset destination folder after uncombine

  Version 1.3.2 / 2017-11-27
  * Add blendshape support
  * Insert instruction of editor script inside a foldout

  Version 1.4.0 / 2017-12-17
  * New feature! Add possibility to combine into SkinnedMesh
  * Prevent a rare case of division by 0 in TextureScale
  * Optmize mesh after combining
  * Add SuperCombiner namespace
  * Correction in texture scaling for tilled textures exceeding maximum possible texture size
  * Improve documentation

  Version 1.4.1 / 2018-01-09
  * Color property of meshes are now supported
  * Improve log message in case of tiled texture
  * Fix texture alpha channel being lost during process
  * Add namespace for all Super Combiner classes
  * Improve code comments
  * Improve documentation
  * Automatically generate default texture color when texture is missing in material
  * Automatically scale textures size when material uses textures with different size
